dwelling.io Society Management and Security System

Problem Statement:
Over a time, many issues have been faced by our society members. One of the challenges they face every day is regarding the intruders that enter in the society without any consent plus there is very little transparency in the working system we have regarding the intruders and CCTV footage. Technology plays a vital role here, by using mobile application for this job can make things easily manageable and it can also help in security related issues.

Proposed Solution: 
This project proposes a “Society Management and Security System” to keep a daily record of the intrudes and can make CCTV footage accessible to all the people living in that particular society. Its feature includes live CCTV footage, live data of the intruders and making emergency calls if any society member feels an issue in that footage. The project’s scope is to extend it for other societies to local factory owners who are facing the same issues regarding the security of the organisation.

Functionality & Concept used:
The App has a very simple and creative interface which helps the society members to access the CCTV footage, the list of intruders and to make an emergency call to the watchman if any unknown person is seen in the footage or in the list. Following are few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in app: 
•	Constraint Layout: Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
•	Simple & Easy View: Use of interactive buttons made it easier for society members to register or sign in without providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also uses App Navigation to switch between different screens.
•	LiveData & Room Database: We are also using LiveData to update & observe any changes in the Bus driver's locations received from their mobile at real time and update it to local databases using Room. Coordinates are then updated in the bus route screen and students can track their route bus location.
•	View Model: Some of the pages uses the concepts of view model.

Application Link & Future Scope:
The app is currently in the system testing stage with Ishmita Homes society. You can access the app: 
Once the app is fully tested and functional in Ishmita Homes society, we plan to talk to neighbouring societies also to propose this app idea and collaborate with them on this security-related service. Also we are planning to include I.O.T in near future for the people living in the society which opens door automatically by viewing IFID on the car so that society members don’t have to wait for the security checks.
